# Django Project

This application is used for a book club.  The landing page displays the different categories with a brief description and a link to the books within the given category.  Some of the features of this application are:

* Registration Form (When someone registers, their account is automatically set as 'inactive'.  An email is sent to the application owner to set the account to 'active' if they want to grant access to the application.)
* Login Form (Allows user to log into the application to view the blog and add comments to blogs.)
* Contact Us Form (A person can submit request to the owner to check on the status of their registration, request the owner start a blog under a specific category or suggest a new category and/or book.)
* Blog (Only active users can view and add comments to the blog page.)
* Logout (User can close their session.)
